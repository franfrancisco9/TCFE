\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

In this section, we will the obtained results by simulating the referred circuit in Ngspice. 

We started with the given ngspice file to simulate the audio amplifier, and further improved my doing incremental modifications, while respecting the suitable parameters.

To decide the final best values, an optimizer was used with octave, that created a new ngspice document in each iteration as to find the suitable and most optimal values.

The obtained values of interest can be found in table \ref{tab:sim1}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
    \hline
    {\bf Element } & {\bf Value} \\
    \hline \hline
    Cost & FALTA \\
    \hline
    Lower Cut Off & FALTA Hz\\
    \hline
    Upper Cut Off & FALTA Hz \\
    \hline
    Bandwidth & FALTA Hz \\
    \hline
    Voltage Gain ($\frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}}$)  & FALTA \\
    \hline
    Input Impedance & FALTA \\
    \hline
    Output Impedance & FALTA \\
    \hline

Using the given expression for the merit it follows that:

\begin{equation}
    Merit = FALTA 
    \label{eq:merit}
\end{equation}

It becomes clear from changing the values the different effects the resistors and capacitors have in the bandwidth and gain.

The coupling capacitors have the clear goal of FALTA , which is FALTA

The bypass capacitor on the other hand, is meant to FALTA, as to FALTA

The $R_c$ resistor also affects gain, since FALTA
