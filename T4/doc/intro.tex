The objective of this laboratory assignment is to design an audio amplifier circuit, by choosing the architecture of the Gain and Output amplifier stages.The referred circuit is shown in the picture below.

As mentioned above, it is also important to refer that we have developed an optimization algorithm (in Octave) in order to find the number of transistors, the values of the resistors and capacitor that would lead to the best value of merit, computed in Ngspice with the formula given by the Professor.
