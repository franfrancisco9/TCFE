% state the learning objective 

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to do analysis on a circuit using the mesh and the nodal method as well as running a simulation using NgSpice with the objective of detecting small diferences between the different approcahes and understand why said differences happen. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
